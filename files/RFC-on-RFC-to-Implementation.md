# Note on RFC to Implementation

## Motivation



## Approach



## Concepts





## Workflow

The workflow approach can be broken down into four macro-phases, which are as follows (Fasttrack approach in D8.5)

The **exploration** phase defines the scope and focus of the use case by addressing the questions raised during the writing of RFCs and the challenges encountered by various stakeholder groups. It identifies stakeholder communities, resources (available technologies and research, LTM capacity, external and internal funding), and actions needed to realise the use case.

The **validation**  phase serves as a lab environment to test and validate hypotheses or     prototypes against stakeholder needs.

The **execution** phase  turns the validated hypotheses or prototypes into market-ready solutions     that can be integrated into the Time Machine infrastructure or exploited     externally.

The **diffusion** ensures involved the planning for the dissemination and exploitation of the use case results and defines next steps that need to be addressed in Research and Innovation Agenda or explored in future use cases. The conclusions from the use case are provided as input for RFCs.
