# Note on Data Graph

## Motivation



## Approach

### Bright Graph, Dark Graph

### Incrementality 

TMO will help setting up ingestion pipelines in a sequential order, structuring progressively the information graph offering ways to more easily ingest certain form of structured sources. Local Time Machine Academy events will be regularly organised to help local communities to use these standard tools as they are being developed. These events will also serve to exchange best practices and consolidate prototypes for future ingestion pipelines.

Consolidated Time Machine Pipelines enable to build the Data Graph in incremental way, starting from the core information structure and progressively attaching the small branches and the leaves. Consolidated Time Machine Pipelines are also the main service that helps small Local Time Machines that are not linked with academic research. This is the cast for hundreds of (smaller) cities across Europe.
